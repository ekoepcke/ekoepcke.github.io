I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. My research combines behavioral economics and household finance. Using a combination of theory, surveys, and both field and lab experiments, I study self-control issues and bounded rationality.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/) in Washington, DC. I hold a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN.

My job market paper measures the extent of self-control issues in the Earned Wage Access fintech space. I will be on the job market during Fall 2022, and I am primarily interested in private sector opportunities.

You can find my CV [here](https://ekoepcke.github.io/files/KoepckeCV.pdf). Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:eric_koepcke@berkeley.edu).
