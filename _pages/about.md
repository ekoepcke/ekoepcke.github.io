I am an Economist and Data Scientist. I work for Uber as an Applied Scientist on the CRM Marketing Science team. I have conducted research in academia, and both the public and private sector, and have communicated research and public policy findings to parties with diverse backgrounds and technical expertise.

I hold a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley and I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I hold a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN.
