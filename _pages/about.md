I am an economist and data scientist. I work for the New York City Council, using data and statistics to help craft and assess legislation. I have conducted research in academia, and both the public and private sector, and have communicated research and public policy findings to parties with diverse backgrounds and technical expertise.

I hold a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley and I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. My dissertation research focused on behavioral and applied microeconomics. Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. I hold a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN.
