I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. My research combines behavioral economics and applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on self-control issues and bounded rationality. My work uses a combination of theory, surveys, and both field and lab experiments.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/) in Washington, DC. I hold a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN.

I am currently on the job market and I am exclusively pursuing private sector opportunities as an Economist or Data/Applied Scientist. I have excellent training in causal inference and designing/implementing experiments and surveys. I have conducted research in academia, and both the public and private sector, and have communicated research findings to parties with diverse backgrounds and technical expertise.

You can find my resume [here](https://ekoepcke.github.io/files/KoepckeResume.pdf) and my CV [here](https://ekoepcke.github.io/files/KoepckeCV.pdf). Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:eric_koepcke@berkeley.edu).
