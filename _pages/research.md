- **“Do Cure Violence Programs Reduce Gun Violence? Evidence from New York City”** (with Rachel Avram, Alaa Moussawi, and Melissa Nunez) (forthcoming)

  - **Abstract:** Cure Violence is a community violence intervention program that aims to reduce gun violence by mediating conflicts, "treating" high-risk individuals, and changing community norms. Using NYC shootings data from 2006-2023, with 28 Cure and 48 control police precincts, we assess the efficacy of Cure Violence by estimating difference-in-differences and event study specifications. We find that, on average, Cure Violence is associated with a 14% reduction in shootings relative to the counterfactual. This association persists in the years after treatment, neither increasing nor decreasing much over time. We exploit variation in the geography and timing of Cure implementation to rule out alternative explanations. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence of spillover effects into nearby precincts and that there are increasing returns to opening new Cure programs. Interpreted causally, using simple calculations, our results imply that around 1,300 shootings were avoided between 2012-2023 due to Cure, generating a net social surplus of $2.45 billion and achieving a benefit-cost ratio of 6.5:1.
